Outlook","regions":["Sheridan"],"severity":"advisory","time":1588264920,"expires":1588437900,"description":"...Rising Water Levels On Foothills Streams This Week... A period of warm temperatures this week is expected to melt an abundant snow pack that is in place over area foothills (5000-7500ft). The latest data from automated snow measurement equipment at these elevations shows abundant levels of water (2 to 5 inches) contained in the snow pack for this date. Snow melt is currently ongoing across the foothills. With warm temperatures in the forecast through the end of the week, much of this snow pack should melt out by the weekend. Flooding is not forecast at this time. However, as this mid elevation snow melts out, significant water rises can be expected on streams and rivers flowing out of the foothills. Smaller streams will see the greatest rises from this mid elevation snow melt. Stream conditions will be changing through the week ahead, which could present difficulties to those recreating on or near the water. Recreationists should expect changing conditions and use extra caution when in and near the water. Those with interests near waterways should move equipment and livestock away from low lying areas. While peak run-off is still a month away for most areas, now is the time to begin preparations to prevent damage from high flows this season.
