authorities regarding guidelines for allowed activities... * The warm air temperatures on Saturday in the mid to upper 60s may cause people to underestimate the dangers of the cold water temperatures which are currently only in the mid 40s across Sebago Lake and Lake Winnipesaukee, as well as area rivers. * The cold water temperatures can quickly cause hypothermia to anyone immersed in the water. According to the US Coast Guard, when the water temperatures are below 50 degrees, the chance of immediate incapacitation due to cold shock is extremely high. Anyone on small boats, canoes, or kayaks should plan accordingly if recreating this weekend and use extreme caution to avoid this threat. Paddle smart from the start and always wear your life jacket! * Due to spring snow-melt and rain, area rivers continue to run fast with swift water currents. The swift water can easily overturn a kayak or canoe into the frigid river waters. Once in the cold water, the strong currents will make it difficult to reach safety. * Gusty winds out of the northwest may reach 20 to 25 mph at times Saturday.\n","uri":"https://alerts.weather.gov/cap/wwacapget.php?x=NH125F4BB28470.SpecialWeatherStatement.125F4BBF0B14NH.GYXSPSGYX.1bfccb616db418cef1a4ef41580d76da"}],"flags":{"sources":["nwspa","cmc","gfs","hrrr","icon","isd","madis","nam","sref","darksky","nearest-precip"],"nearest-station":2,"units":"us"},"offset":-4}
